                        It was created by Cmd Cat, a development team with my partner and I! We wanted to make something 
                        that would encourage the healthy habit of journaling, in a convenient and quick way. We created 
                        the extension using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I worked on all visual aspects of the project, 
                        which included the UI design, artwork, HTML, and CSS styling. It is fully functioning and available for both Firefox and Google Chrome!"

                        Otherwise, the overall layout remained consistent to these first designs throughout development."

                        thoughts and “grow” as a person. With this, I implemented a new color palette of blue and green. 
                        Blue functioned as a more heavy color to indicate sadness on the emotion ranking system, while green 
                        indicated happiness (and also linked back to the plant theme). I also designed a calendar page

                         endless pollution in the name of convenience and economy. This project exemplifies what may happen

                          of nature is in simulations, as the existing versions would no longer be beautiful.
                           I use images from my own trips to national parks, 3D modeling, and UI design to create an
                            interface that would be used to build out a custom environment which can then be experienced in a simulation by the user."

                         Users would be able to collage together images of environmental settings to be converted to a 3D model, which could then be experienced in VR.
                          To create the model, I imported my cut-up images into Blender and constructed the land how I wanted. I also added a larger body of water."
