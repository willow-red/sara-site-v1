            <h4>background</h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Sara! I am a 4th year student at the University of Southern California.✌️<br></br><br></br>
                I entered university with no knowledge of what coding was. As a freshman, I took a class in computer simulations to fulfill a GE.
                After writing my first program in MatLab
                (<a className="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Conway's Game of Life</a>),
                I became enamored with the art of programming!<br></br><br></br>
                The following semester, I decided to pursue a minor in computer programming, and have since continued to learn
                both in the classroom and independently.<br></br><br></br>
                In addition to being a self-proclaimed developer, I am a <a className="link" href="https://willowred.art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">multimedia artist</a>! My
                two passions seem distinct in concept, but I strive to combine them in my projects to create something unique.<br></br><br></br>
                With my knowledge of art, design, and code, I create digital products that are beautiful, inside and out.
                My main focuses are web development, ui, and product design.</p>
